<h1>Introduction to the Web</h1>

<b>World Wide Web</b>
<p>HTML- HyperText Markup Language<br>
HTML is the main type of document on the web<br>
Major pieces of the web are: myself, computer, internet,
and servers.<br>
This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-
3508959201/m-48724340">Components of the Web</a> video gives
a perfect quick overview.<br>
Basically, the web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.<br>
When a person goes to a web page like www.udacity.com, their computer sends<br>
a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document<br>
and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets<br>
the page and displays it on the user's screen. 
</p>

<b>HTML Attributes</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing in HTML,<br>
we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML  <b>tags</b>.<br>
This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/1-3508959201/m-48723444">Intro to HTML Tags</a> explains everything well.<br>
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an <br>
"invisible box" around the content inside them. 

</p>

<b>Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Why are computers stupid? The reason computers are stupid is because<br>
they interpret instructions literally and programmers need to write <em>exactly</em><br>
the way a computer understands.
